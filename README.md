Code may not work out of the box or without dependencies -- snippets taken from live project. Including dependencies may reveal who we are -- so we just provided proof of concept code.

`L1StandardBridge.sol` is a real smart contract used in OP stack rollups. It's the `L1Bridge` in the paper.
`ResolverRegistry.sol` is the real candidate for the contract of the same name in the paper.
All other files are just code snippets to show we can do what we claim in the paper.
